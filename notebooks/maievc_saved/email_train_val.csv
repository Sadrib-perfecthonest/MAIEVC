Helga is already working on a shrine.  Top StoryGetty ImagesTo the Moon and BackThe StoryNASA’s Artemis I mission is set to take off.Let the countdown begin. For the first time in nearly 50 years, NASA is launching a mission to the moon — using its most powerful rocket ever. There won’t be any astronauts on board. But today’s launch is a crucial test that marks the start of NASA’s eagerly awaited new lunar program. Now — specifically, at 8:33 am ET — it’s time for blast off. (Here’s how to watch.)Mission details, Houston. The mission’s spacecraft will travel more than 1.3 million miles around the moon over the course of 42 days. But ultimately this is all about preparing to bring humans back to the moon as soon as 2025...for the first time since 1972. NASA hopes to reach the moon’s unexplored south pole, where there might be ice in craters to support future crews. And it hopes to lay the groundwork for future missions to Mars by using the moon’s surface for training and testing.theSkimmNASA’s return to the moon has been decades in the making and cost billions to fund. Now it’s time to see whether the long-awaited program will give us the moon, or if expectations will have to come back to Earth.  And Also...ThisWhat’s got us trying to read in between the lines…The Mar-a-Lago affidavit. On Friday, the Department of Justice released a heavily redacted 32-page affidavit. It’s the document the FBI used to get a warrant to search former President Donald Trump’s home in August. The affidavit confirms that secret documents were recovered from Mar-a-Lago earlier in the year. Reminder: back in January, Trump’s team returned 15 boxes of government documents to the National Archives after taking them home from the White House. The affidavit says those included 184 documents labeled as “secret,” “confidential,“ or “top secret.” And contained info about “clandestine human sources“ (think: spies or informants) that could have been dangerous in the wrong hands. Fast forward to August: the FBI went back to Trump’s residence with their warrant, and found 11 additional sets of classified documents. The DOJ hasn’t commented beyond the release of the affidavit, but in June it said the documents hadn’t been “handled in an appropriate manner.“ Trump’s spokesperson says that there was no reason for a search and that it’s “all politics.” Who’s saying ‘I did it first’…Moderna. Last week, the Massachusetts-based company sued Pfizer and the German drugmaker BioNTech for patent infringement. Moderna says that Pfizer and BioNTech hit copy and paste on its mRNA tech for their COVID-19 vaccine. Moderna claims it filed the patents way back between 2010 and 2016. The company pledged not to enforce its patent when the pandemic was in full force. And it says it isn’t trying to get Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines off the market now. But it wants companies to respect its intellectual property and request proper permission to use its work. Both Pfizer and BioNTech responded that their work is original, and say they’ll defend themselves in court.…Oh and speaking of vaccines, the Biden admin is expected to have Omicron-specific boosters ready around the week after Labor Day.What’s got parents talking…Missouri. This summer, Cassville R-IV School District in western MO gave the ‘OK’ to bring back spanking. The district told parents that it would start swatting students with paddles as a punishment for misbehavior. Kids would only be spanked if their parents give written permission — with a choice to opt out later. The district also claims it will only swat kids as a last resort and that it will not be done in front of their peers. Other rules: two workers must be present (the spanker and a witness) and they cannot hit students in the head or face. The measure is a school board response to a survey sent to parents, students, and staff, which found that parents were worried about student behavior. Many states have outlawed corporal punishment in schools — but Missouri is one of 19 that still allow it.Who’s GOAT us in our feels…Serena Williams.

Please provide informations instead of literature. I am happy that 
everything contains the right value for you, but this brings us nowhere. 
so I'll repeat myself.

- print the value of $mailbox (to logs or whatever) so that you see what 
it is.
- ls -la /mnt/gluster/$mailbox/ ... etc
.

and _show_ the results. and while I am in,

- what system are you running? is selinux/apparamor/... enabled?

There are many different setups out there. if the whole mailstore 
belongs to vmail, then under a standard unix, vmail can do everything in 
the mailstore.

And this after I pointed out the same problem with another directory  
to Mark just a few weeks ago :)  I believe this is fixed now - ping  
me again if it isn't.

Unless Mark beats me to it, I should be able to do this in a day or  
two (assuming the changes he made to py2exe removing the requirement  
for Outlook 2000 work!).

I'll also check the .zip file at the same time, but I'm pretty sure  
we never had a problem with ones that Anthony did, so it should be fine.

Tony

After reading the Wikipedia entries for the TLDs that they list as unused, I would be in 
favor of removing all of them

  bv gb pm sj so um yt

If spammers can't use them as domains, then all including them could do would be to 
generate false positives.

The three listed as ""phaseout"", su tp yu, on the other hand, I would keep, because it 
appears from the Wikipedia articles that they are in active use either during a transition

If we can reach consensus on this, I'll make the changes to the code I committed.

Depending on your hardware, there is at least one more.  If you have an 
HP OfficeJet, that has fax capability, there is HPLIP, which provides 
for scanning, printing, and faxing.  It sets up a printing queue for the 
fax, so as you mention further down you print from the app to the ""fax 
printer"", and then use HPLIP's GUI hp-toolbox to send the document.  It 
works pretty well.  I use it with an OfficeJet 5610.  HTH

Nowhere have I said anything about not being able to create new users.

All the above quote is stating is, ""....bestows Administrative rights on 
*anyone* [my emphasis] who logs into the computer,...."".

What you write is, of course, all very exciting - except that for the 
Joe-in-the-street who buys a copy of the Home edition (AND Professional, 
BTW) will not have a damn clue that you need to use the OS as a user 
with NO Administrator privileges.

Which is why openSUSE was created.

"Hi,

i have a couple of questions regarding sasl.

In main.cf i have:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
smtpd_sasl_local_domain=
smtpd_sasl_path=smtpd

broken_sasl_auth_clients=yes

smtpd_recipient_restrictions=permit_mynetworks,permit_sasl_authenticated,reject_unauth_destination

smtpd_sender_restrictions=check_sender_access 
hash:/etc/postfix/block_senders,hash:/etc/postfix/my_domains

smtpd_sender_login_maps=ldap:/etc/postfix/local_recipients.cf

smtpd_sender_restrictions=reject_authenticated_sender_login_mismatch

smtpd_restriction_classes=verify_login

verify_login=reject_sender_login_mismatch

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
in my_domains:

mydomain1 verify_login
mydomain2 verify_login
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Using this configuration user1@mydomain1 cannot pretend he is a 
different user. For example, he cannot send an email saying he is 
user2@mydomain2.

Question1: How can i exclude a user from this rule based on his IP? in 
main.cf i've added: mynetworks=127.0.0.1, his_ip_address but it does not 
work.

Question2: The rule above works fine for all users when they use a 
webmail client or any other client. The only problem is with users who 
use squirrelmail. They still can send emails with a fake ""from address""! 
Postfix cannot stop them.

Any ideas?

Thanks in advance,

Alex

Is there any way to check if ""."" precedes the disconnect? I

Of course you need to find the right words... Be helpful and firm. Tell 
them:
- you will whitelist them (so you're very open)
- but you don't want anyone else to be whitelisted. so they must own the IP
- they must take responsibility for all mail coming out of that IP
- they may have delivery issues elsewhere. they may not realize it, but 
some sites may be discarding their mail. And if that didn't happen yet, 
chances are this will happen in the future. Many people are getting sick 
of supporting zombies because of broken sites.

In short, their system is not configured according to the standards:
- a helo name must be an fqdn hostname (or an IP literal)
- their system must have a correct reverse DNS: IP->name->IP must result 
in the original IP.

It would have been easier if you showed your config. you need to put a 
check_client_access that returns OK but you must not put this in the 
wrong place.

here is an acceptable example:

smtpd_recipient_restrictions =
    ...
    reject_unauth_destination
    reject_non_fqdn_sender
    reject_non_fqdn_recipient
    ...
    reject_invalid_hostname
    check_client_access cidr:/etc/postfix/broken_client
    reject_non_fqdn_hostname
    ...


== broken_client
10.1.2.3/32      OK


In short, you should move your reject_non_fqdn_hostname down enough to 
be able to add the broken_client check before it without affecting other 
checks.

a less appealing alternative is to make your reject_non_fqdn_hostname a 
result of a check_client_access:

==
10.1.2.3/32      DUNNO
0.0.0.0/0          reject_non_fqdn_hostname

but this will only add complexity.

No.

The problem is, that if you enable such access, your VM (virtual
machine) will no longer be isolated, so the code will leak, and it may
destroy data on your host (physical PC).
This is very unsafe.

	My head is officially melted - situations like this make me hate
not only computers but the fuckers who work with them, every person who
uses them sucessfully and pretty much anyone else on the planet. aaargh
	
	here is my machine specs:
http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?docname=c00783657&cc=us&lc=e
n&dlc=en&product=3357149&dlc=en⟨=en
   
	
	I've installed the chipset software from Nvidia for my
motherboard hoping that this would fix the issue. 
	I've installed realtek drivers to specifically try fix the
networking issue. Once they install I see no change on my device
management setup. no new network cards listed, just the standard
ieee1394 controller. 
	
	My Other Pci Bridge Device and SM Bus Controller are still being
listed as other devices..
	
	I'm going round in circles here and am at odds with reinstalling
vista just because I can't find the right driver. 
	
	Vista is pretty, but clunky and a resource eating beast. I've
already forked out on extra RAM and at 2gb I've hit capacity for my
machine. (Thats not including the capacity I've added through ready
boost) 
	
	I want XP (I never thought I'd hear myself say that)!
	
	plus this stupid fucking italian keyboard is making everything
all the more infuriating...whats the point in me meditating when
technology is lurking round every corne to thwart my good will. 
	
	
	cheers,

smtpd restrictions only apply to mail sent via smtp. if squirrelmail 
uses the sendmail command, then that won't work. and since squirrelmail 
always exectutes as the same user (your webserver uid), there's not much 
to do except finding a way for squirrelmail to implement the restriction.

It very much depends on the power supply in question.
Today i would recommend buying one with over 80% efficiency.
These often reach up to 85% efficiency,
but only when they operate around 50% load:
Power Supplies 101: A comprehensive guide Motherboards.org:
http://www.motherboards.org/articles/guides/1487_7.html

The study you quote may be a bit outdated (2002)
or be valid for cheap PSUs (Compaq).
It is certainly good to check the characteristics
of the PSU before you buy one:
http://www.80plus.org/manu/psu/manu_psu.htm

But as seen earlier in this thread,
calculating the power consumption needs
of the components used is not always easy.

Kind regards     Philippe

It seems that the caller info is pointing to the next ""executable""

If you look in regcomp in pregcomp (i think) you can find code the
gets from %^H. Setting from C I havent done.

Dear Elizabeth,1,ai
"Hi, I've got following problem. Sometimes mail attachments are truncated and and e-mail is send but files are corrupted.  Mail header contains then: ""X-Amavis-Alert: BAD HEADER MIME error: error: part did not end with expected boundary"". And that is true - there is no boundary for MIME and data stream is not completed. I've turned on detailed postfix debugging and it looks like at some point there is:   smtp_get: EOF instead of:  < some_IP: QUIT  > some_IP: 221 2.0.0 Bye Attachment is truncated after different sizes (sometimes 65kB, sometimes 200kB) and after different times (25s, 100s). The only common thing I've found is that all such mails come from one internet provider that is public-gprs*.centertel.pl I guess it might be the problem with this provider (Orange Poland) but on the other hand they can send e-mails through other mail servers without such a problem. I got stuck with it. Is there any way to debug it more? Do you have any ideas what could be the cause? I use postfix 2.3.8 on Debian Stable + amavis etc. Thanks in advance! Jakub",0,human

Sorry, must have missed this along the way - didn't see any reference to 
Vista, the discussion I thought was all about XP.

A friend is using the Home edition and I haven't ""played"" with it 
(because I didn't want to get tangled up with Home edition :-) ) so 
cannot comment for or against that you have both Admin and user accounts 
on it. All I know is what I heard, and read (and quoted above) about the 
Home edition of XP.

Of course, it is in XP Professional that most people who use it at home 
who never get past the first account - the Administrator - and do not 
create a user with limited access rights.

The need to create a normal, limited access, user in XP Professional is 
not something which is enforced in Professional which is why, I 
understand, most XP Prof. setups are being run by a home user with full 
Admin. rights. I cannot see why the Home edition should be more security 
conscious than the Professional edition, and also cost much less, unless 
SP1 and SP2 introduced the ability to create limited-access users in the 
Home edition.

Ciao.

I've tried upgrading some dual-life modules and several fail, mostly because
some of the very basic modules fail, like PathTools:

Er.. So I have a rail of ""ok"" but Test::More still thinks there's a
failing test.


OTOH, the same failures occur with 5.5.3 so at least they weren't
introduced by 5.5.5

Tell the client to fix his helo name. ""Spam-Server"" is more than non

Hylafax is a fax server (a very good one), and as such, it doesn't need a 
GUI - same as most or all services in Linux don't. However, there are many 
clients that can connect to hylafax and some of them are GUIs; there are 
java clients, for example, that work in windows. Just have a look at the 
hylafax website and choose one you like.

Because faxes are sent to the server as postscript, and because it usually 
sends them to the user as postscript, too (or tiff or pdf, if so 
configured). You don't see the raster.

For example, you can configure your system as a mail server that converts 
mails to faxes and sends them, and viceversa. Or you can print to a samba 
printer that faxes the pages. There are many possibilities.

Dear John,1,ai
"Hi Leon,

thanks for your effort!

To compile on recent Gentoo systems, ext/IPC/SysV/SysV.xs needs
some tweakage. In blead, this was fixed by change #31702. However,
this doesn't work for 5.005, as HAS_GETPAGESIZE and HAS_SYSCONF
are not determined by Configure.

I'm pretty confident that the  include isn't needed
on Linux. I've been testing this with a vanilla RedHat installs
back to RH 5.2 (Linux 2.0.36 #1 Tue Oct 13 22:17:11 EDT 1998),
and they work fine without the header. But there may be be some
platform dependency, so I think a safe approach would be to
remove the include for x86-Linux only. Here's a patch:


--- perl5.005_05-MAINT20070902/ext/IPC/SysV/SysV.xs     2007-05-31 16:59:31000000000 +0200
+++ perl5.005_05-MAINT20070902-mhx/ext/IPC/SysV/SysV.xs 2007-10-03 14:57:38000000000 +0200
@@ -3,7 +3,7 @@
 #include ""XSUB.h""
 
 #include 
-#ifdef __linux__
+#if defined(__linux__) && !defined(__i386__)
 #   include 
 #endif
 #if defined(HAS_MSG) || defined(HAS_SEM) || defined(HAS_SHM)


With this, all tests pass on all my Linux systems.

Marcus

Does MOVEFILE_REPLACE_EXISTING mean the rename over an existing file is actually
atomic?  I cannot find any MSDN docs that say so (and I've seen some that
suggest to me that it probably isn't).

If it's not atomic, then this doesn't offer any advantage over shutil.move that
I can see (and in fact would damage the usefulness of os.rename, which is
currently atomic on all platforms AFAIK, even though it cannot succeed all the
time).

If MOVEFILE_REPLACE_EXISTING miraculously turns out to be atomic, then my
opinion is:

  * this feature would be very useful, and I would like a cross-platform way to
    do this in Python.
  * this feature should not be called ""os.rename"", which for years has done
    something else on some platforms, and so changing it will invite unnecessary
    breakage.  A new function would be better, or perhaps an optional flag.  I
    propose ""os.atomic_rename"".

Also, I assume this cannot replace files that are in use?

I'd be ok with a flag, but it should have a cross-platform name.
""require_atomic"" or ""replace"" or something like that.  I think a new function
makes more sense, though.

I don't quite follow what you're saying here, but I'd be against an operation
called ""rename"" that sometimes was atomic and sometimes wasn't.

Does MoveFileEx solve the atomicity problem that Guido raised in that thread?  I
don't think it does, so I think the situation is still the same.

"Greets.

I have a weird problem with 10.1 and using home,end,backspace,delete etc in
console programs (vi for example). On bash prompt using home, end doesn't
work (nothing happens, while it should move cursor to start or end of the
line). Using vi home,end works, but when in insert mode, I can't use
backspace (nothing happens), delete works as long as there are characters on
the line, when there are no more characters available, it should delete the
line and move to next but that doesn't happen. This doesn't seem to be a
problem in 10.3 when I'm connected directly, but if I ssh from 10.1 to 10.3
server same thing happens. I'm guessing some terminal issue but I wasn't
able to pinpoint it.

Does MOVEFILE_REPLACE_EXISTING mean the rename over an existing file is actually

I'd be ok with a flag, but it should have a cross-platform name.
""require_atomic"" or ""replace"" or something like that.  I think a new function
makes more sense, though.

Does MoveFileEx solve the atomicity problem that Guido raised in that thread?  I
don't think it does, so I think the situation is still the same.

In this case it's a single directory yes, but i've generalized it to  
'fix unsafe paths' on VMS.
What would be the proper way to reconstruct the path after the '/'  
trick on VMS?

Please provide informations instead of literature. I am happy that 
everything contains the right value for you, but this brings us nowhere. 
so I'll repeat myself.

- print the value of $mailbox (to logs or whatever) so that you see what 
it is.
- ls -la /mnt/gluster/$mailbox/ ... etc
.

and _show_ the results. and while I am in,

- what system are you running? is selinux/apparamor/... enabled?

There are many different setups out there. if the whole mailstore 
belongs to vmail, then under a standard unix, vmail can do everything in 
the mailstore.

Helga is already working on a shrine.  Top StoryGetty ImagesTo the Moon and BackThe StoryNASA’s Artemis I mission is set to take off.Let the countdown begin. For the first time in nearly 50 years, NASA is launching a mission to the moon — using its most powerful rocket ever. There won’t be any astronauts on board. But today’s launch is a crucial test that marks the start of NASA’s eagerly awaited new lunar program. Now — specifically, at 8:33 am ET — it’s time for blast off. (Here’s how to watch.)Mission details, Houston. The mission’s spacecraft will travel more than 1.3 million miles around the moon over the course of 42 days. But ultimately this is all about preparing to bring humans back to the moon as soon as 2025...for the first time since 1972. NASA hopes to reach the moon’s unexplored south pole, where there might be ice in craters to support future crews. And it hopes to lay the groundwork for future missions to Mars by using the moon’s surface for training and testing.theSkimmNASA’s return to the moon has been decades in the making and cost billions to fund. Now it’s time to see whether the long-awaited program will give us the moon, or if expectations will have to come back to Earth.  And Also...ThisWhat’s got us trying to read in between the lines…The Mar-a-Lago affidavit. On Friday, the Department of Justice released a heavily redacted 32-page affidavit. It’s the document the FBI used to get a warrant to search former President Donald Trump’s home in August. The affidavit confirms that secret documents were recovered from Mar-a-Lago earlier in the year. Reminder: back in January, Trump’s team returned 15 boxes of government documents to the National Archives after taking them home from the White House. The affidavit says those included 184 documents labeled as “secret,” “confidential,“ or “top secret.” And contained info about “clandestine human sources“ (think: spies or informants) that could have been dangerous in the wrong hands. Fast forward to August: the FBI went back to Trump’s residence with their warrant, and found 11 additional sets of classified documents. The DOJ hasn’t commented beyond the release of the affidavit, but in June it said the documents hadn’t been “handled in an appropriate manner.“ Trump’s spokesperson says that there was no reason for a search and that it’s “all politics.” Who’s saying ‘I did it first’…Moderna. Last week, the Massachusetts-based company sued Pfizer and the German drugmaker BioNTech for patent infringement. Moderna says that Pfizer and BioNTech hit copy and paste on its mRNA tech for their COVID-19 vaccine. Moderna claims it filed the patents way back between 2010 and 2016. The company pledged not to enforce its patent when the pandemic was in full force. And it says it isn’t trying to get Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines off the market now. But it wants companies to respect its intellectual property and request proper permission to use its work. Both Pfizer and BioNTech responded that their work is original, and say they’ll defend themselves in court.…Oh and speaking of vaccines, the Biden admin is expected to have Omicron-specific boosters ready around the week after Labor Day.What’s got parents talking…Missouri. This summer, Cassville R-IV School District in western MO gave the ‘OK’ to bring back spanking. The district told parents that it would start swatting students with paddles as a punishment for misbehavior. Kids would only be spanked if their parents give written permission — with a choice to opt out later. The district also claims it will only swat kids as a last resort and that it will not be done in front of their peers. Other rules: two workers must be present (the spanker and a witness) and they cannot hit students in the head or face. The measure is a school board response to a survey sent to parents, students, and staff, which found that parents were worried about student behavior. Many states have outlawed corporal punishment in schools — but Missouri is one of 19 that still allow it.Who’s GOAT us in our feels…Serena Williams.

Dear Lisa,1,ai
Dear David,1,ai
"I would like to be able to send and receive faxes using my openSUSE v10.3 
system. A bit of looking around showed that there are not many 
applications to do this -- actually only one, HylaFax, which I thought 
likely to be more capable than the combination of sendfax+mgetty, I have 
downloaded and installed HylaFax.

Surprisingly, HylaFax does not sport a GUI, as far as I have been able to 
discover. I find it difficult to believe that many people, having 
acquired a sophisticated operating system like SuSE, will be content with 
command-line operation, so I have to wonder if I have overlooked another 
available application. What do people do for fax service in SuSE? Or do 
only few people use this OS for faxing?

I have stumbled upon a Java app that is intended to be a GUI for HylaFax. 
This is SUSEFax, which seems to be the product of someone at SuSE in 
Germany. It was first released in 1997 (sic), but is also available in a 
later beta (v1.0beta3) dated 1999, even for x86_64 at RPM.PBONE.NET.

It is labeled src.rpm for SuSE v9. Before I get into compiling it 
(something I have not done so far), I would like to ask some questions 
about it. 

The 1997 webpage says that the docs are in German only. A later user wrote 
on a forum that the 1999 release has English docs, but all the labels in 
the GUI are in German (a decade after first release, and still in beta). 
Does anyone have later information? Has the developer recovered a desire 
to finish what he started? The program shouts ""Half-Done Abandonware""

Fax apps on other OSes make the sending operation a matter of ""printing"" 
from the application that created the document to the fax app; does 
SUSEfax do that? This is not mentioned in any of the webpages I have 
found. It is said only that one can send faxes from the phone book. So at 
minimum, there are at least two stages in sending a fax.

The HylaFax webpage speaks of the need for Ghostscript. What is this for? 
Since faxes arrive in raster form, not as either ASCII codes or 
Postscript formatting information, what does Ghostscript have to 
contribute to the fax function?

No, as I've found in:
# postconf | grep smtpd_proxy
smtpd_proxy_ehlo = $myhostname
smtpd_proxy_filter = 
smtpd_proxy_timeout = 100s

Hm, so that looks strange - there is no before-queue but mail is

Is there any way to check if ""."" precedes the disconnect? I

"Hi Jess,

if you haven't yet seen previous BBC articles, the intent is to bring
the bleeding edge perl people together with those whose modules on
CPAN suffer from expected changes in the next version of perl. You may
not be amused by the fact that your module has an issue with
bleadperl, but chances are good that the problem can be resolved
before 5.10 comes out if only somebody chimes in to explain what's the
issue.

See the facts. Somehow your code triggers a different behaviour of
perl since patch 26487

    (http://public.activestate.com/cgi-bin/perlbrowse/p/26487)
    Change 26487 by nicholas@nicholas-saigo on 2005/12/26 12:31:01

        Rework constant.pm to take advantage of the space savings of proxy
        constant subroutines whenever it can.

which leads to a test failure:

    t/37-translator-graph......Can't locate object method ""is_trivial_link"" via package ""GLOB"" at /home/sand/.cpan/build/SQL-Translator-0.08001-oWjySe/blib/lib/SQL/Translator/Schema/Graph.pm line 46.
    # Looks like you planned 3 tests but only ran 2.
    # Looks like your test died just after 2.
    dubious
            Test returned status 255 (wstat 65280, 0xff00)
    DIED. FAILED test 3
            Failed 1/3 tests, 66.67% okay

I had no success when I tried to reduce the bug to a small testcase,
sorry.

Maybe Nicholas will follow up with an explanation what is happening?

Hope this helps,

smtpd restrictions only apply to mail sent via smtp. if squirrelmail 
uses the sendmail command, then that won't work. and since squirrelmail 
always exectutes as the same user (your webserver uid), there's not much 
to do except finding a way for squirrelmail to implement the restriction.

Yes, right. But from latin1: manedit does not support utf.

Doesn't seem complicated... I've never done a sed script. I was thinking 
of doing it in pascal, just for the laugh of it, but sed would 
maintainable by others if needed.

Yes...

I could work on the ""file.in"" file, and the Makefile would handle whatever 
it currently does, plus the conversion, producing the file.1

It should. But it also should exist a man/troff editor for dummies: it 
doesn't even require graphics, it could be done in a terminal. It is a 
vetust format, a reliq of times well past, but here it is, alive and 
kicking. Specially that, kicking me.



I have seen a procedure to generate troff out of opendocument format (in 
the Heirloom Project). I haven't tested it, but I wonder. If that works, 
it would make things like spell checking much easier.

Yes. I have found a reference to a webpage describing how to send faxes 
through CUPS (www.jennings.homelinux/fax_cups.html), which sounds 
interesting. Unfortunately, the site no longer exists, although the URL 
still brings up the server.

I have implemented SASL authetication. Trend Micro Net Suit is being used as
the anti spam/anti virus software. Since last few days I am finding that
some of the users (out of total 900+ users 3 has reported the issue so far)
are not able to send mail to any address outside of my domain. The log entry
that I am getting is something like

Feb  8 15:54:29 mail postfix/smtpd[9334]: NOQUEUE: reject: RCPT from
unknown[59.183.54.228]: 554 : Recipient address
rejected: Access denied; from=
to= proto=SMTP helo=

>From the log I can see that many mails are getting delivered to outside
domains without any problems. But the users who are getting the problem are
not able to send any mail to outside world. But these same users are able to
send mail to anyplace when they use IMAP. For web interface I am using
squirrelmail.

I am trying to get helps using google but not successful. May I request you
to kindly give some clue on how I should proceed?

Subject: Re: NorthTec Account/Password

This still doesn't work.

The ""not used before"" can't be relevant here, because this is a
completely new account.
In case the initial setup was triggering the ""previous 24 hours"", I
didn't do anything with it yesterday and tried today, so that can't be
relevant.

The password ""ABcd23."" is exactly 7 characters long, has a mixture of
uppercase, lowercase, and symbols, doesn't include my name, and isn't
accepted. (This isn't the password I would prefer to use, but it's an
example of one that doesn't work, but matches what you said).

The error I get is:

""""""
The password supplied does not meet the minimum complexity
requirements. Please try again.
Your password has expired and must be changed. Please change your
password now.
""""""

It seems clear that the username must be correct, otherwise it
wouldn't be telling me that it has expired.

Any further suggestions?

Thanks,
Tony

This is not related to the original question, but is it possible to match
""anything else"" (like you do with /./ in this pcre map) in bdb hash maps?

I tried to implement the %^H approach, but I could work out how to set/get %^H
in C code in way that actually achieved the right effect.

I tried implementing the warnings approach by having C (and above)
do C ;
in the same way that C does C
but I got a test failure in t/op/reg_namedcapture.t

I attach the guts of the later patch, in case someone can work out what is wrong.
The simplest failure is 
% env PERL_DESTRUCT_LEVEL=1 ./perl -Ilib -e 'keys %!'
Assertion he->shared_he_he.hent_hek == hek failed: file ""hv.c"", line 2257 during global destruction.

Any suggestions welcome.

Robin

Hello,

 

i've been using spambayes for ages without any problems. Now I have a
server running that delivers me voicemails and unanswered calls from my
telephone system. Even afer marking ~ 20 of this mails as ham and doing
some extra training on a folder containing only those messages, they
keep on getting marked as possible spam.

 

Can you please give me a hint what screw I have to turn to get all mails
from this sender? I attached a sample of these mails.

 

Thanks a lot,

 

Wilhelm K.

After reading the Wikipedia entries for the TLDs that they list as unused, I would be in 
favor of removing all of them

  bv gb pm sj so um yt

If spammers can't use them as domains, then all including them could do would be to 
generate false positives.

The three listed as ""phaseout"", su tp yu, on the other hand, I would keep, because it 
appears from the Wikipedia articles that they are in active use either during a transition 
period or because their phaseout is being resisted.

If we can reach consensus on this, I'll make the changes to the code I committed.

Had some trouble deploying dkim-milter-2.4.4 on postfix-2.4.6 (debian etch backports - tried etch 2.3.8 and had the same troubles) and mailman_2.1.9-7.

DKIM-milter is deployed and signing and verifing mode with its primary intent to sign emails on lists.cacert.org mailing lists.

Feb  7 09:27:09 lists postfix/master[22912]: daemon started -- version 2.4.6, configuration /etc/postfix
I deployed it as a typical and sole milter
smtpd_milters = unix:extern-milter/dkim-filter.sock
non_smtpd_milters = $smtpd_milters

Testing on a tiny email list and the email came through signed by dkim.

Feb  7 10:28:29
an email when through to a larger email list poptem-kkrrvq@lists.cacert.org without any error

after a significant number of hours without a peep out of dkim-filter I start to get.

These occured for these same to email recipients, every 15 minutes from until Feb  7 21:00:15 when I woke up in a haze. noticed it was failing and turned it off.
The dkim-milter still seems to be running happliy on its unix socket.

This is also noted on 
http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=476123D1.5000602%40hetnet.nl
(the second error). I still can't get a total grasp of whats happing though.

Any tips on how to isolate this error would be really welcome as I really don't want to be trialing on a live system too much.

Too bad, I hoped that there is still the possibility to boot the installed

I know, that was the reason to let Vahe first try it the easy way. BTW,

Current Committee Vacancies - Get on board!!*

There are currently a few positions available. If you are interested, 
please contact Anneka Vuletich 421-0919 in the first instance.

*_President_* (Approximately three hours per month)
This involves setting the agenda for the monthly meetings and
running them, writing the president's blurb that appears in the
newsletter each month, and general support of committee.

_*Vice President*_
VP is currently unfilled. It is a support role to President and would
include assisting with committee meetings and upcoming events.
It would probably average about two hours per month.

*_Antenatal Packs_ *(three hours per month)
Ordering and photocopying pamphlets as required. You are required to 
make up two packs per couple for each antenatal course and you need the 
space to store two large containers.

_*Antenatal Leader*_
Remember your antenatal class? The person who set up and helped “glue” 
the class together? Want to emulate her? This is a paid position if one 
person will do all the classes to provide consistency. There is 
currently a total of seven per year. Otherwise, if you’re thinking of 
adding to your family or just want an antenatal update – volunteer as a 
Leader for one course (seven Wednesday nights).

*_Newsletter Editor_ *(five hours plus every second month_)_
Collate material for this newsletter from other committee members and 
own topics. All advertising is supplied by the advertising co-ordinator. 
The newsletter is currently formatted in Microsoft Publisher.

_*Baby & You Course Convener*_

There are six Baby and You courses booked for 2008. This is a very 
critical role as Baby and You forms part of the core course that HBC 
Parents Centre promotes.
It may be possible for two people to run this course.
The tasks include:
Set up in week one and pack down in week five
Booking venue – Whangaparaoa library
Confirming speakers
Making sure that speakers are paid on time
A Saturday CPR course - one per course
Reviewing course evaluations
Making sure that accurate statistics are kept
Organising hosts to assist in the following Baby and You course

In this case it's a single directory yes, but i've generalized it to  
'fix unsafe paths' on VMS.
What would be the proper way to reconstruct the path after the '/'  
trick on VMS?

"Hi,

I've got following problem. Sometimes mail attachments are truncated
and and e-mail is send but files are corrupted. 

Mail header contains then:
""X-Amavis-Alert: BAD HEADER MIME error: error: part did not end with
expected boundary"". And that is true - there is no boundary for MIME and
data stream is not completed.

I've turned on detailed postfix debugging and it looks like at some
point there is: 
 smtp_get: EOF
instead of:
 < some_IP: QUIT
 > some_IP: 221 2.0.0 Bye

Attachment is truncated after different sizes (sometimes 65kB, sometimes
200kB) and after different times (25s, 100s).

The only common thing I've found is that all such mails come from one internet
provider that is public-gprs*.centertel.pl

I guess it might be the problem with this provider (Orange Poland) but
on the other hand they can send e-mails through other mail servers
without such a problem.

I got stuck with it. Is there any way to debug it more? Do you have any
ideas what could be the cause?

I use postfix 2.3.8 on Debian Stable + amavis etc.

Thanks in advance!
Jakub

"Quite bizarre.

http://ask.metafilter.com/72827/Stolen-car-returned-within-minutes-Why

    Can you help solve a somewhat bizarre and mysterious crime?

    Here's the background story: My friend owns a late-model mini-van,
    in very good condition. She had the van parked on the basement 3rd
    level (B3) of a parking garage under the Tokyo Dome Hotel, which is
    adjacent to the Tokyo Dome, a sports arena in downtown Tokyo (seats
    55,000 people), as well as an amusement park and a small shopping
    mall. Here's a link to a map showing the position of the hotel,
    the Dome and surroundings.

    The hotel was fully booked for a Japanese holiday period, and only
    registered guests at the hotel would be able to gain access to the
    hotel parking garage. My friend, who lives in Tokyo, was able to
    park there that day, however, as she has a relative working at the
    hotel who gave her a pass. She and her family came to the hotel for
    dinner, arriving around 4PM. She returned to the garage at around 9PM
    the same evening. She went to retrieve her car, but couldn't find
    it on the B3 level where she'd parked. Wondering if she'd confused
    her parking place, she went one level up, to B2. There she found
    her van. Aside from the fact that it was on the wrong floor, she
    noticed that it had been parked front-end in, whereas she had backed
    her van into her parking place on the B3 level. The car was locked:
    nothing seemed remiss, there were no traces that it had been broken
    into, and nothing in the car (baby seat, miscellaneous kid's toys,
    etc.) was missing.

    My friend went first to hotel personnel, who called the police. Police
    arrived at the hotel and inspected the car. They dusted for
    fingerprints, they took her fingerprint samples to compare. They
    questioned her about all details, speaking with her from around 10PM
    til around 1AM. They told her they had dusted for fingerprints on
    the steering wheel and gear shift, and had found nothing.

    The surveillance tapes (which police showed to my friend) show a man
    driving out of the garage in her mini-van at 6:30PM . Tapes also show
    a man who is dressed identically but who appears to be a different
    person (this also according to police who viewed the tapes) returning
    only 12 minutes later, at 6:42PM. The tapes show the man driving
    with the palms of his hands and/or his forearms, so as not to leave
    prints. And although the weather was very hot that day the man (men)
    were wearing an unbuttoned dress shirt over a t-shirt, plus a baseball
    cap. Police told my friend that the shirt tail would've been used to
    work the gearshift, so as not to leave prints. This man had the kind
    of pass that a hotel guest would have, in order to leave the garage
    in a vehicle, and return in a vehicle. This pass is also necessary
    to gain entrance into the hotel building from the garage. This man
    was also seen in surveillance tapes shot inside the hotel.

    The street layout of the hotel/Dome complex requires a driver to
    take a rather roundabout route, circling the Dome, in order to get
    out of the complex and onto any other city streets. This route takes
    approximately 10 minutes. The car was gone from out of the garage
    for only 12 minutes, so it's safe to say it didn't go very far!

    One last thing: the Tokyo cops who talked to my friend told her
    that these guys seemed very professionsl and then they told her that
    they'd probably never be caught!

    Why would someone steal a car out of a garage, keep it for such a
    short time, then have it returned so quickly (by another person in
    identical clothing)?

+1 to switching, and +1 to doing it now.  This reason (diffing  
offline) is really the only noticeable difference for me, with the  
limited way that I use CVS/SVN, but it's a huge benefit (not just to  
be able to do it offline, but the big speed up and removal of the  
logging in requirement).

This seems *way* too high. If there have been only 20 messages total in
that folder, sa-learn should have processed these in a few *seconds* or
less.

What did you expect? Based on your numbers above, processing that folder
would have taken 10-20 *hours*...

Hmm. Kmail doesn't start one process per mail by any chance?

Dunno if there are limitations -- however, your 7k messages should be
perfectly fine. Just ran a test on a 6k messages mbox file, and there
was no noticeable difference to a 30 messages test.

Well, the destruction technically happens *after* the undef
instruction has finished. So the current COP points at the next
statement. Which might be far away... or might even not have a line
number associated to it. That happens if the undef() call is done at
the end of an END block.

I understand that might be not practical, but that's the first time I
hear about this problem and I don't have really an idea about a
possible and efficient solution.

Dear Jennifer,1,ai
"While investigating some issues with regards to object destruction, I 
came upon this little oddity.  Take this program:

= foo ================================================
sub Foo::DESTROY {
     (undef, $filename, $line) = caller;
     print ""called from $filename, line $line\\n""
}

my $foo = bless {}, 'Foo';
undef $foo;  # destruction *not* reported at this line

my $bar;     # line at which destruction of object is reported
======================================================

If you run this, you get:

   called from foo, line 9


It seems that the caller info is pointing to the next ""executable"" 
line (line 9), rather than where the actual destruction is taking 
place (line 7). Well, at least where the destruction is taking place 
from a ""naive"" user's point of view.  ;-)


I assume this is basically the way it is, right?  Seems to be like 
this in every version of Perl I could get my hands on.

The Japanese eat very little fat and suffer fewer heart attacks than the
British or the Americans.

On the other hand, the French eat a lot of fat and also suffer fewer heart
attacks than the British or the Americans.

The Japanese drink very little red wine and suffer fewer heart attacks than
the British or the Americans.

The Italians drink excessive amounts of red wine and also suffer fewer heart
attacks than the British or the Americans.

Conclusion: Eat and drink whatever you like. It's speaking English that
kills you.

But many power supplies are only efficient when

I always keep a second small installation in a separate partition, for

Better let each install do it's own grub into its root or boot partition, 
not the mbr. That way they don't collide.

Of course you need to find the right words... Be helpful and firm. Tell 
them:
- you will whitelist them (so you're very open)
- but you don't want anyone else to be whitelisted. so they must own the IP
- they must take responsibility for all mail coming out of that IP
- they may have delivery issues elsewhere. they may not realize it, but 
some sites may be discarding their mail. And if that didn't happen yet, 
chances are this will happen in the future. Many people are getting sick 
of supporting zombies because of broken sites.

In short, their system is not configured according to the standards:
- a helo name must be an fqdn hostname (or an IP literal)
- their system must have a correct reverse DNS: IP->name->IP must result 
in the original IP.

It would have been easier if you showed your config. you need to put a 
check_client_access that returns OK but you must not put this in the 
wrong place.

here is an acceptable example:

smtpd_recipient_restrictions =
    ...
    reject_unauth_destination
    reject_non_fqdn_sender
    reject_non_fqdn_recipient
    ...
    reject_invalid_hostname
    check_client_access cidr:/etc/postfix/broken_client
    reject_non_fqdn_hostname
    ...


== broken_client
10.1.2.3/32      OK


In short, you should move your reject_non_fqdn_hostname down enough to 
be able to add the broken_client check before it without affecting other 
checks.

a less appealing alternative is to make your reject_non_fqdn_hostname a 
result of a check_client_access:

==
10.1.2.3/32      DUNNO
0.0.0.0/0          reject_non_fqdn_hostname

but this will only add complexity.

This seems *way* too high. If there have been only 20 messages total in
that folder, sa-learn should have processed these in a few *seconds* or
less.

What did you expect? Based on your numbers above, processing that folder

Hmm. Kmail doesn't start one process per mail by any chance?

Dunno if there are limitations -- however, your 7k messages should be
perfectly fine. Just ran a test on a 6k messages mbox file, and there
was no noticeable difference to a 30 messages test.

Here I go. I'm writing this notes as I go, but I'll post when I finish.


1) It is designed for an older set of libraries.

Gtk-WARNING **: Failed to load module ""libgnomebreakpad.so"": libgnomebreakpad.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

But it does exist, in ""/usr/lib/gtk-2.0/modules/libgnomebreakpad.so"". I 
guess it is looking for an older version.


2) It does not support UTF8

It displays latin1, and when I type an accented letter it displays two 
strange letters - so no utf. I had to start an xterm in latin1:

   LANG=en_US.ISO-8859-1 LC_ALL=en_US.ISO-8859-1 /usr/bin/xterm -bd blue &

and from there I fire up manedit.

This could be the worst problem of all, because there is no way to edit in 
utf8 with manedit. Do you know if current man pages are supposed to be UTF 
or latin1?

[see later]

3) It is an XML editor, which it translates to troff when saving; and it 
is not WYSIWYG - but that is what you said in your write up. I'd like it 
to have a toggle to show the formatted output, but no.


4) It warns that if I enable syntax highlighting, it may crash. So far it 
hasn't, but who knows...

5) I can not even change the font size: the letters get substituted by 
squares, or I loose accents. I had to delete the configuration file to 
restore working defaults. It must be a byproduct of not supporting utf.


[...]

I haven't finished yet, but I found a blocker.

The program does it job fairly well, but the locale encoding turns out to 
be a problem.

I asked the people of the project for whom I'm translating their 
pages, whether they wanted the pages in latin1 or utf8, and the answer is 
""neither"":

]  Characters outside the ASCII printable range must be encoded; see
]  groff_char(7) (but note that we use ""\\('e"" rather than ""\\['e]"").


This is a problem too with manual pages in the suse distro: they either 
display well in latin 1 or in utf 8, but not both. And using the encoding 
described in groff_char(7) they display correctly in both. The blocker is 
that manedit does not support that encoding.

I would have to write ""ol\\('e"" instead of ""olé"", which may be just 
a nuisance for a coder, but it is a big inconvenience for a writer: I can 
not spell check the file, and my sight doesn't see ""olé"" but gibberish, so 
I can't proofread the text.

:-/

I don't understand how nobody has created a good program for writing 
documentation ""man"" files by mere mortals, not by coders. And I do 
understand now why some projects refuse altogether to create a man page 
and make do instead with html or pdf files, or why man page translations 
are so obsolete as to be useless, when they do exist.


I have also discarded (and some tried) gmanedit, gconglomerate, gjots2, 
pandoc, zoem...

I don't know what I will do. :-/

"
is paraphernalia another Guard word, like vehicles?

(I just figured out why guards pronounce ""vehicle"" like ""veh hicle""
instead of ""vee hicle"", btw, it's because they have to fill out bilingual
forms all the time and the literal gaeilge translation is ""feithicil"".)

Worth noting this is leafy Grangegorman we're talking about here.
Glasnevin doesn't have this kind of behaviour, we just find Time Capsules.

no, but you can achieve that by using restriction classes.

If the check you run is at the end of a restriction ""set"", and is simple 
enough (no map lookup in particular), you can simply order the checks 
such as in
    # checks for some clients
    check_client_access hash:/etc/postfix/foo_access
    ... [checks for other clients]

== foo_access:
unknown      do_this, do_that, permit

1. Check Network Configuration
2. Download list of online reprositories
3. Inialize the reprository manager

my problem appears in step 2 where i have got the following message:

Unable to download list of reprositories or no reprositories defined

finished installation i added the OSS reprository by clicking yast -->
Community Reprositories?

reprositories to install from them new packages

"Hi,

i have a couple of questions regarding sasl.

In main.cf i have:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
smtpd_sasl_local_domain=
smtpd_sasl_path=smtpd

broken_sasl_auth_clients=yes

smtpd_recipient_restrictions=permit_mynetworks,permit_sasl_authenticated,reject_unauth_destination

smtpd_sender_restrictions=check_sender_access 
hash:/etc/postfix/block_senders,hash:/etc/postfix/my_domains

smtpd_sender_login_maps=ldap:/etc/postfix/local_recipients.cf

smtpd_sender_restrictions=reject_authenticated_sender_login_mismatch

smtpd_restriction_classes=verify_login

verify_login=reject_sender_login_mismatch

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
in my_domains:

mydomain1 verify_login
mydomain2 verify_login
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Using this configuration user1@mydomain1 cannot pretend he is a 
different user. For example, he cannot send an email saying he is 
user2@mydomain2.

Question1: How can i exclude a user from this rule based on his IP? in 
main.cf i've added: mynetworks=127.0.0.1, his_ip_address but it does not 
work.

Question2: The rule above works fine for all users when they use a 
webmail client or any other client. The only problem is with users who 
use squirrelmail. They still can send emails with a fake ""from address""! 
Postfix cannot stop them.

Any ideas?

Thanks in advance,

Alex
