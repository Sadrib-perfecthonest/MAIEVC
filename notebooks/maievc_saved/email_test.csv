I'm sorry, but you got the wrong address to complain about spam. This is a
list for the developers and user who use this program you are using to
read your mail (called Squirrelmail). About your problem you have to ask
your mail provider, I guess the company may be called VCN.

Greetings

It is not the client hostname that is rejected, it's the helo name that the 
client itself determines to announces itself to the receiving server.

This is especially stupid since you have to configure the helo of your own system.

So you can only kick the admin of the server with the non-fqdn-helo or 
whitelist the client.

yeah, exactly, that would be a good way to solve the problem.

I just assumed that unix vs inet problems were chroot related however i'm 
willing to try the inet path (I was limited due to vserver firewall rules

It's all a usability (http://www.useit.com/alertbox/) problem. You

i've installed the Plugin image_buttons-1.4-1.4 on squirrelmail

everything works fine.

Now I only want to adjust the Webinterface, because when I move the

the right frame isn't fixed, so the hole right frame goes up and down

"Hello Everybody,

I am using RHEL 4 with postfix postfix-2.2.10-1.RHEL4.2. The authentication

the anti spam/anti virus software. Since last few days I am finding that
some of the users (out of total 900+ users 3 has reported the issue so far)
are not able to send mail to any address outside of my domain. The log entry
that I am getting is something like

Feb  8 15:54:29 mail postfix/smtpd[9334]: NOQUEUE: reject: RCPT from

>From the log I can see that many mails are getting delivered to outside
domains without any problems. But the users who are getting the problem are
not able to send any mail to outside world. But these same users are able to
send mail to anyplace when they use IMAP. For web interface I am using
squirrelmail.

Dear Mr. Robert Thompson,1,ai
Dear Christopher,1,ai
"Another conference that may be of interest to those in computer science, 
information technology, or otherwise computationally related fields. It has 
been particularly pointed out, that also IS and other related fields are very 
welcome.

Last year the conference featured a ""Geeks and Suits"" event for career 
planning contacts with the (related) industry. Additionally excellent New 
Zealanders as key note speakers who have become internationally famous (Ian 
Foster as the ""godfather"" of Grid Computing, Craig Neville-Manning from 
Google, ...).

It was definitely worth it, and I expect it to be good again.

Tell the client to fix his helo name. ""Spam-Server"" is more than non 
fqdn. it's a provocation!

if you prefer to surrender, then remove reject_non_fqdn_hostname (or 
reject_non_fqdn_helo_hostname).

KDE:KDE4:STABLE:Extra-Apps - addons that are released independently from KDE (amarok, koffice, etc) and maintained by Novell employees (via e.g. openSUSE Factory) KDE:KDE4:STABLE:Community - anything else the same layout exists for UNSTABLE (e.g. KDE 4.1 snapshots): KDE:KDE4:UNSTABLE:Desktop KDE:KDE4:UNSTABLE:Extra-Apps KDE:KDE4:UNSTABLE:Community the 3 repositories are also duplicated as backports, which will contain some of the applications, if they compile against the distro version of Qt, kdelibs and kdebase-runtime. This way you don't have to update your whole KDE just to get a new e.g. amarok or digikam. KDE:KDE4:Backports:Desktop KDE:KDE4:Backports:Extra-Apps KDE:KDE4:Backports:Community The other previously existing KDE4 related repositories under KDE: prefix have already vanished or will disappear in the near future.

"Hi all,

Could it be that during installation IPv6 is not enabled?
At work aswell as at home i've my own installation-server / gwdg-mirror.
Identical setup, but at home i use for all my vhosts an V6 address.

After a system is installed, i can upgrade or add aditional repo's
without any problem with my IPv6 servers.

However during the initial installation the installation source coming
froman IPv6 address are not recognised.

If i perform a DVD-installation, just before the first boot, i saw that
the module ""ipv6"" is not loaded. 
I presume this could be the reason.

Any suggestions how i can load this module in grub before installation
takes place, so that i can add my own installationsources?

I just assumed that unix vs inet problems were chroot related however i'm 
willing to try the inet path (I was limited due to vserver firewall rules 
when I don't control the host).

Well, the destruction technically happens *after* the undef
instruction has finished. So the current COP points at the next
statement. Which might be far away... or might even not have a line
number associated to it. That happens if the undef() call is done at
the end of an END block.

I understand that might be not practical, but that's the first time I
hear about this problem and I don't have really an idea about a
possible and efficient solution.

Very interesting. After a lot of googling, jHylafax never turned up. But 
now I know why SUSEfax has been a decade without update -- it morphed to 
jHylaFax. Since the SUSEfax page still exists at Sourceforge, on the 
other hand, one wonders why its developer hasn't thought to put a single 
sentence in it to point to jHylaFax. I do have a thought about that, but 
this isn't the place for it.

"My head is officially melted - situations like this make me hate not only
computers but the fuckers who work with them, every person who uses them
sucessfully and pretty much anyone else on the planet. aaargh

here is my machine specs:
http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?docname=c00783657&cc=us&lc=en&dlc=en&product=3357149&dlc=en⟨=en


I've installed the chipset software from Nvidia for my motherboard hoping
that this would fix the issue.
I've installed realtek drivers to specifically try fix the networking issue.
Once they install I see no change on my device management setup. no new
network cards listed, just the standard ieee1394 controller.

My Other Pci Bridge Device and SM Bus Controller are still being listed as
other devices..

I'm going round in circles here and am at odds with reinstalling vista just
because I can't find the right driver.

Vista is pretty, but clunky and a resource eating beast. I've already forked
out on extra RAM and at 2gb I've hit capacity for my machine. (Thats not
including the capacity I've added through ready boost)

I want XP (I never thought I'd hear myself say that)!

plus this stupid fucking italian keyboard is making everything all the more
infuriating...whats the point in me meditating when technology is lurking
round every corne to thwart my good will.


cheers,

Richard

* I officially hate HP, realtek, Windows and every other fucking site I've

It is not the client hostname that is rejected, it's the helo name that the 
client itself determines to announces itself to the receiving server.

This is especially stupid since you have to configure the helo of your own system.

So you can only kick the admin of the server with the non-fqdn-helo or 
whitelist the client.

What link? The spample does not show any. Also, the DNS queries relevant
for SA are those to the various blacklists. By default including URI as
well as IP blacklists.

Anyway, you can't prove the non-existence of a DNS issue, by one
successful query. So we now know that it works at least sometimes. Good,
we pretty much knew that before. ;)

Did you try asking qmail-scanner folks already? That is not the default
SA header.

Because it has been (auto?) learned before?

So?  Hey, I'm not a qmail-scanner guy, that was not meant as a
